The Computational Reasoning and Discovery Lab develops computational methods for analyzing complex biomedical data, combining classical statistical approaches with modern machine-learning techniques. Our work spans settings ranging from limited and noisy medical datasets to large-scale analyses that require high-performance computing and scalable workflows.

We focus on applications in genomics, bioinformatics, and precision medicine, with an emphasis on interpretability, privacy, and responsible use of computational methods in medical settings. Our research aims to produce reliable and meaningful results that support scientific understanding and medical insight.
