**Abstract**

An ongoing computational biology project involving the large-scale generation and analysis of bacterial gene-pair datasets, integrating codon bias, GC content, operon adjacency, and genomic context features, with the goal of enabling downstream modeling and public release of structured bacterial genomic interaction data.
