**Abstract**

An ongoing study investigating machine learning methods for predicting disease severity and adverse outcomes in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD), using high-dimensional clinical features from small cohorts, with a focus on clinically meaningful endpoints such as progression to critical limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) or major amputation.
