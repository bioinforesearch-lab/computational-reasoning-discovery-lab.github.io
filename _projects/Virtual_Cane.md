An Android application designed to assist visually impaired individuals by detecting objects and measuring distances in real time. The system combines MiDaS for monocular depth estimation and MobileNet for lightweight object detection, integrated into a Java-based mobile interface optimized for efficiency and low latency.

The application translates visual information into haptic feedback and voice alerts, enabling users to detect obstacles, measure distance, and move more safely and independently.
